This project is used to collect user-behavior from the mobile intelligent terminal.
The reason why did I make it is I want to build a framework which can collect,simulate and predit the user-behavior. 
The framework is divied into two parts. 
Firstly we should collect the users' behavior, Secondly we need to build a  user-behavior model by using the data collected by the framework.
